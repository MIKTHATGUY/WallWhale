**WallWhale** is a production-ready server for downloading and hosting Steam
Workshop content with enterprise features. Built with TypeScript, Fastify,
and Prisma, it provides secure API access, multi-account Steam integration,
audit logging, and comprehensive monitoring. The system supports bulk downloads,
automated deployments, and scales horizontally with Docker and Kubernetes.

Get started in 60 seconds:

```bash
# Docker (recommended)
docker-compose up -d
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Local development
npm install && npm run db:push && npm run setup && npm run dev
```

## Core components

**API Server** (`src/index.ts`, `src/routes/`) - Fastify web server with
authentication, rate limiting, and OpenAPI documentation. Handles download
requests, user management, and real-time monitoring endpoints.

**Download Engine** (`src/services/downloadService.ts`, `src/utils/depotDownloader.ts`) -
Orchestrates Steam Workshop downloads using the DepotDownloader binary.
Manages concurrent downloads, queue processing, and retry logic.

**Database Layer** (`prisma/schema.prisma`, `src/plugins/prisma.ts`) - Prisma
ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL support. Stores user accounts, download history,
audit logs, and system configuration.

**Authentication System** (`src/plugins/auth.ts`, `src/utils/crypto.ts`) -
Dual authentication with JWT tokens and API keys. Supports role-based access
control and session management.

**CLI Tools** (`src/commands/`, `src/utils/`) - Command-line interface for
server setup, certificate management, direct downloads, and maintenance
operations.

**File Hosting** (`src/utils/fileHosting.ts`, `src/utils/directDownload.ts`) -
Static file server with password protection, download tracking, and bandwidth
limiting for serving downloaded workshop content.

**Monitoring & Logging** (`src/plugins/audit.ts`, `src/utils/audit.ts`) -
Comprehensive audit logging, Prometheus metrics, health checks, and
structured JSON logging for production observability.

**Security Layer** (`src/utils/certificates.ts`, `src/plugins/register.ts`) -
TLS certificate management, input validation, CORS configuration, and
secure headers for production deployments.

## API workflow

Download a workshop item:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/downloads \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"workshopId": "123456789", "steamAccount": "account_name"}'
```

Monitor progress:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/downloads/download-id \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-key"
```

## Production deployment

Docker Compose with external database:

```bash
# Set environment variables
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/wallwhale"
export JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Verify deployment
curl https://your-domain.com/health
```
